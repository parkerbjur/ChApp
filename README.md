# Welcome to StackEdit!

Welcome to ChApp a revolutionarily old school Chat App. This app utalizes websockets to connect multiple users to a single synchronized chat room. Users also have the ability to move to different rooms and create rooms at their whim. 

# Functionality
First the user will sign in with their username:

Then the user will be loaded into room1 by default which will be the general chat for all users. The user can also use the side menu to navigate to other rooms:

Users can also go to the buttons at the top to select to create a new room: 
![](./"View Create Rooms.png")

They will be brought to a new screen where they can input the name of the room as well as if they would like the room to be permanent or not. If the user does not want their room to be permanent then as soon as the amount of users reduces to zero then the room and all history of the room will be deleted.
